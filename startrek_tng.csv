MCCOY!Almost as bad.
MCCOY!They are, they are. And damned annoying at times.
MCCOY!Well, this is a new ship, but she's got the right name. Now youremember that, you hear.
MCCOY!You treat her like a lady, and she'll always bring you home.
PICARD!You will agree, Data, that Starfleet'sorders are difficult?
PICARD!As simple as that.
PICARD!It's hardly simple, Data, to negotiate a friendly agreement forStarfleet to use the base while at the same time snoop around findinghow and why the life form there built it.
PICARD!Data, how can you be programmed as a virtual encyclopedia ofhuman information without knowing a simple word like snoop?
PICARD!It means to spy, to sneak.

DATA!Are you undamaged?
DATA!All systems operating.
DATA!Unlikely, sir. Our records show that you supervised all Bandicontact with other worlds.
DATA!Most interesting, sir.
DATA!But no sound of power. No equipment.
DATA!Most intriguing again, sir. The place that this vessel was firingupon was not the Farpoint starbase, but the home of those whoconstructed. Sorry, sir. I seem to be commenting on everything.
DATA!And firing not on the new space station, but on the Bandi andtheir city.
DATA!Ready for departure, sir.
USS!You will agree, Data, that Starfleet'sorders are difficult?
USS!Ah, Commander Riker, I thought you'd want to know we've still noword from your vessel. I trust we made your waiting comfortable?
RIKER!Luxurious is more like it.
RIKER!Would I seem ungrateful if I ask for some information?
RIKER!Fascinating, the advanced materials used in constructing thisspace station. Your energy supply must be as abundant as I've heard.
RIKER!Thank you. But it still seems incredible to me that you couldhave constructed this station so rapidly and so, so perfectly suited toour needs.

RIKER!Just hoping this isn't the usual way our missions will go, sir.
SOLDIER!Get to your feet, criminals!
SOLDIER!Attention! On your feet. Attention! Q
WESLEY!Mother, it's Commander Riker.
WESLEY!Yes, sir.
WESLEY!If you're wondering about Mom, Commander Riker, she's notunfriendly. She's just shy around men she doesn't know.
WESLEY!Mom, that gold pattern wasn't there.
WESLEY!When I was little, he brought my father's body home to us.
WESLEY!Sir?

r, Captain.Â B'ETOR
CRAIG!Aye, sir.
CRAIG!Aye, sir. All stop.
SHANTHI!None of which is ourconcern, Jean-Luc. The Klingon civil war is, by definition, an internalmatter of the Empire.
SHANTHI!Some would call it good leadership.
SHANTHI!What is it you propose, Captain?
SHANTHI!A blockade.
SHANTHI!But how would you overcome the Romulan cloaking device?
SHANTHI!I'll have to clear this with the Federation Council. In themeantime, assemble your fleet, Captain.
KULGE!Maybe they have better leaders. I say you have failed as ourleader, Gowron.
PICARD!Apparently the Tamarians arrived atEl-Adrel Four nearly three weeks ago. They have been transmitting asubspace signal towards Federation space ever since.
PICARD!Apparently so, Number One. Starfleet believes that theirpresence is an attempt at communication. Commander.
PICARD!Agreed. I appreciate your prudence, Mister Worf, but Starfleetbelieves that the Tamarians have extended a hand. We must do the same.
PICARD!Indeed. Are they truly incomprehensible? In my experience,communication is a matter of patience, imagination. I would like tobelieve these are qualities we have in sufficient measure.
